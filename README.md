# UXProject
A remote usability testing tool, created as part of my final year project at university. 

Note: In order for the solution to run fully, a database (generated from ORM model found in the solution) and FTP server will have to be set up, and ip addresses would have to be edited in the various configuration files.

For more information you can refer to my report also created as part of the project/dissertation:
